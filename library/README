This folder contains the source files for our glibc wrapper library.

At the moment, it contains a simple proof-of-concept library testlib.c
and a test program test.c.

To verify that interception is working:

1) Execute ../install/install.sh with root permissions
2) cd to this directory
3) Run make clean test
4) Execute bin/test
5) Verify that a log message is written to stderr. The message should look like "LOG: intercepted open call with file=test.txt, flags=65, mode=448"
